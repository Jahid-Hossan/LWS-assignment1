This is a responsive React-based landing page project completed as part of the **Batch 3 Assignment** from _Learn with Sumit_. The project was bootstrapped using **Vite** and styled with **Tailwind CSS v4**. The page is built by converting a given `index.html` file into reusable React components following modern development best practices.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) (custom setup)
- JSX & Component-based Architecture

## ✅ Assignment Tasks Completed

- Initialized a new React project using `npm create vite@latest`.
- Installed and configured **Tailwind CSS v4**.
- Converted all sections of the provided `index.html` into modular **React components**:
  - `Header`
  - `Hero`
  - `Services`
  - `Features`
  - `FAQs`
  - `Footer`
- Built **reusable components** for repeated UI patterns (e.g., feature cards, service items).
- Created separate **SVG icon components** for each inline SVG used in the original design.
  - Example: `<GoogleIcon />`, `<GithubIcon />`, `<CartIcon />`, etc.
- Ensured the design matches the provided HTML visually and structurally.
